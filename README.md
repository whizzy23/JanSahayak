# JanSahayak – Municipal Grievance Management System

JanSahayak is a full-stack municipal grievance management system. Citizens can report municipal issues through WhatsApp, and the system supports efficient issue resolution through a web portal with role-based dashboards for administrators and employees.

## Project Workflow

1. Citizen reports an issue via WhatsApp.
2. An NLP service (spaCy) classifies the urgency of the issue.
3. Admin reviews and assigns the issue to an employee (status: "assigned").
4. Employee updates the issue with resolution status (resolved/unresolved), comments, and resolution date.
5. Admin verifies the resolution and closes the issue (status: "closed").
6. User can track the issue status via WhatsApp.

## How to File an Issue via WhatsApp

> ⚠️ *Note: Due to Twilio's free-tier limit, only 2–3 issues can be filed per day.*

1. **Register your number**  
   Send the join code **"join wish-machinery"** to **+1 415 523 8886** to register with the WhatsApp bot (Twilio Sandbox).

2. **Start the Conversation**  
   Send **"Hi"** to the WhatsApp bot to begin.

3. **Follow the Prompts**  
   - Send **"report"** to start filing an issue.
   - Select the appropriate **department**.
   - Provide your **location**: city, street (optional), landmark, and pincode.
   - Describe the **issue** clearly.
   - Optionally, **upload a photo** related to the issue.

4. **RESET and BACK Commands**  
   - Send **"reset"** to restart the issue filing process.
   - Send **"back"** to return to the previous step.

5. **Track Your Complaint**  
   You can track the current status of your issue by simply messaging the bot.
